A Zygisk module which fixes "MEETS_DEVICE_INTEGRITY" for Android <13 "deviceRecognitionVerdict" with the Play Integrity API.

To use this module you must have one of the following (latest versions):

- [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) with Zygisk enabled (and Enforce DenyList enabled if NOT also using [Shamiko](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed.github.io/releases) or [Zygisk Assistant](https://github.com/snake-4/Zygisk-Assistant) or [NoHello](https://github.com/MhmRdd/NoHello), for best results)
- [KernelSU](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU) with [Zygisk Next](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext) or [ReZygisk](https://github.com/PerformanC/ReZygisk) module installed
- [KernelSU Next](https://github.com/KernelSU-Next/KernelSU-Next) with [Zygisk Next](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext) or [ReZygisk](https://github.com/PerformanC/ReZygisk) module installed
- [APatch](https://github.com/bmax121/APatch) with [Zygisk Next](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext) or [ReZygisk](https://github.com/PerformanC/ReZygisk) module installed

## About module

It injects a classes.dex file to modify fields in the android.os.Build class. Also, it creates a hook in the native code to modify system properties. These are spoofed only to Google Play Services' DroidGuard (Play Integrity) service.

## About 'custom.pif.json' file

You can fill out the included template [example.pif.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osm0sis/PlayIntegrityFork/main/module/example.pif.json) from the module directory (/data/adb/modules/playintegrityfix) then rename it to custom.pif.json to spoof custom values to the GMS unstable process. It will be used instead of any included pif.json (none included currently).

Note this is just a template with the current suggested default entries, but with this fork you can include as few or as many android.os.Build class fields and Android system properties as needed to pass DEVICE verdict now and in the future if the enforced checks by Play Integrity change.

As a general rule you can't use values from recent devices due to them only being allowed with full hardware backed attestation. A script to extract the latest Pixel Beta fingerprint is included with the module; see the autopif2 section below for usage and caveats, and see the Resources below for information and scripts to help find a working private fingerprint.

Older formatted custom.pif.json files from cross-forks and previous releases will be automatically migrated to the latest format. Simply ensure the filename is custom.pif.json and place it in the module directory before upgrading.

A migration may also be performed manually with `sh migrate.sh` and custom.pif.json in the same directory, or from a file explorer app that supports script execution.

## About 'custom.app_replace.list' file

You can customize the included default [example.app_replace.list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osm0sis/PlayIntegrityFork/main/module/example.app_replace.list) from the module directory (/data/adb/modules/playintegrityfix) then rename it to custom.app_replace.list to systemlessly replace any additional conflicting custom ROM spoof injection app paths to disable them.

## About 'autopif2.sh' and 'killpi.sh' script files

There's intentionally no pif.json in the module because the goal remains to be futureproof, and including something that may be banned and obsolete within days would be contrary to that goal. If you don't care to have your own private fingerprint to use or don't have time to look for one currently (since very few remain) then simply run the generation script from a root manager app that supports the module Action button, a root prompt with `sh autopif2.sh --preview` in the module directory (/data/adb/modules/playintegrityfix), or from a file explorer app that supports script execution. For arm/x86 devices wget2 is required but may be installed via [addon module](https://xdaforums.com/t/tools-zips-scripts-osm0sis-odds-and-ends-multiple-devices-platforms.2239421/post-89991315).

The autopif2 script generates a random device fingerprint from the latest Pixel Beta, ideally only to test an initial setup, since they expire roughly every 6 weeks from the Pixel Beta release date (dates included in the generated fingerprint), and the public mass-used ones from other modules or ROMs may also get banned or may be banned for RCS use while otherwise passing Play Integrity in that time. Notable advanced commandline options are: `-p` or `--preview` forces not to ignore Android Platform Preview builds (Developer Previews and Betas); and `-d #` or `--depth #` chooses the depth to crawl down the QPR Betas list when there are multiple active Betas, e.g. when QPR2 is concurrent with QPR1 the default value of 1 would get the first listed (QPR2) and `-d 2` would force it to get the second listed (QPR1).

The killpi script forces the Google Play Services DroidGuard (com.google.android.gms.unstable) and Play Store (com.android.vending) processes to end, making them restart with the next attestation attempt; useful for testing out different fingerprints without requiring a reboot in between.

## Troubleshooting

Make sure Google Play Services (com.google.android.gms) is NOT on the Magisk DenyList if Enforce DenyList is enabled since this interferes with the module; the module does prevent this using scripts but it only happens once during each reboot.

Note: The below verdicts are all referring to the Android <13 deviceRecognitionVerdict Play Integrity API, not the Android 13+ deviceRecognitionVerdict (which relies on locked bootloader checks to pass even DEVICE verdict).

### Failing BASIC verdict

If you are failing MEETS_BASIC_INTEGRITY something is wrong in your setup. Recommended steps in order to find the problem:

- Disable all modules except this one
- Try a different (ideally known working) custom.pif.json

Note: Some modules which modify system (e.g. Xposed) can trigger DroidGuard detections, as can any which hook GMS processes (e.g. custom fonts).

### Failing DEVICE verdict (on KernelSU/KernelSU Next/APatch)

- Disable Zygisk Next
- Reboot
- Enable Zygisk Next
- Reboot again

### Failing DEVICE verdict (on custom kernel/ROM)

- Check the kernel release string with command `adb shell uname -r` or `uname -r`
- If it's on the [Known Banned Kernel List](https://xdaforums.com/t/module-play-integrity-fix-safetynet-fix.4607985/post-89308909) then inform your kernel developer/ROM maintainer to remove their branding for their next build
- You may also try a different custom kernel, or go back to the default kernel for your ROM, if available/possible

### Failing DEVICE verdict (on custom ROM)

- Check the ROM signing keys with command `adb shell unzip -l /system/etc/security/otacerts.zip` or `unzip -l /system/etc/security/otacerts.zip`
- If the output shows the ROM is signed with the AOSP testkey then inform your ROM maintainer to start signing their builds with a private key for their next build and ideally also provide a ROM signature migration build to allow users to update to it without requiring a data wipe
- There is an experimental advanced feature to attempt to work around this by spoofing the ROM signature in Package Manager, see the spoofing Advanced Settings section below
- You may also try a different custom ROM, or go back to the stock ROM for your device, if available/possible

### Failing Play Protect/Store Certification and/or Google Wallet Tap To Pay Setup Security Requirements

- Reflash the module in your root manager app
- Clear Google Wallet (com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel) and/or Google Pay (com.google.android.apps.nbu.paisa.user) cache, if you have them installed
- Clear Google Play Store (com.android.vending) and, if present, Google Play Protect Service (com.google.android.odad) cache and data
- Clear Google Play Services (com.google.android.gms) cache and data, or, optionally skip clearing data and wait some time (~24h) for it to resolve on its own
- Reboot

Note: Clearing Google Play Services app ***data*** will then require you to reset any WearOS devices paired to your device.

### Read module logs

You can read module logs using one of these commands directly after boot:

`adb shell "logcat | grep 'PIF/'"` or `su -c "logcat | grep 'PIF/'"`

Add a "verboseLogs" entry with a value of "0", "1", "2", "3" or "100" to your custom.pif.json to enable higher logging levels; "100" will dump all Build fields, and all the system properties that DroidGuard is checking. Adding the entry can also be done using the migration script with the `sh migrate.sh --force --advanced` or `sh migrate.sh -f -a` command.

## Can this module pass MEETS_STRONG_INTEGRITY?

No...

## About spoofing Advanced Settings

The advanced spoofing options add granular control over what exactly gets spoofed, allowing one to disable the parts that may conflict with other kinds of spoofing modules, and provide an option to work around the testkey ROM ban for those needing that feature. See more in the Details area below.

<details>
<summary><strong>Details</strong></summary>

- Adding the Advanced Settings entries is best done using the migration script with the `sh migrate.sh --force --advanced` or `sh migrate.sh -f -a` command. They may also be added on initial setups using the `sh autopif2.sh --advanced --preview` or `sh autopif2.sh -a -p` command or configured directly for Tricky Store to achieve <A13 STRONG or A13+ DEVICE or STRONG integrity (see below) with the `sh autopif2.sh --strong --preview` or `sh autopif2.sh -s -p` command. Other than for the "verboseLogs" entry (see above), they are all 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled).

- The "spoofBuild" entry (default 1) controls spoofing the Build Fields from the fingerprint; the "spoofProps" entry (default 1) controls spoofing the System Properties from the fingerprint; the "spoofProvider" entry (default 1) controls spoofing the Keystore Provider; the "spoofSignature" entry (default 0) controls spoofing the ROM Signature, and the "spoofVendingSdk" entry (default 0) controls spoofing ROM SDK_INT/sdkVersion 32 to the Play Store (com.android.vending) to force Play Integrity to use the <A13 verdicts.

- Leaving spoofVendingSdk enabled is NOT recommended, it [will break](https://github.com/osm0sis/PlayIntegrityFork/pull/30) the behavior of the Play Store to some extent (back gesture/navbar button for all, account sign-in and downloads for higher original ROM SDK_INT) and could have other unintended effects like incorrect app variants being served, crashes, etc. One possible use case is with the [spoofVendingSdk QSTile](https://xdaforums.com/t/tricky-store-bootloader-keybox-spoofing.4683446/post-90118016) Tasker App to quickly toggle it on only as needed, then toggle it off again afterward.

- For spoofing locked bootloader and attempting to pass Play Integrity <A13 STRONG or A13+ DEVICE or STRONG verdict I only recommend using the latest official [Tricky Store](https://github.com/5ec1cff/TrickyStore) build.

- Note: Using Tricky Store to achieve <A13 STRONG or A13+ DEVICE or STRONG integrity (with an unrevoked hardware keybox.xml) requires the Advanced Settings "spoofProvider" disabled and the "*.security_patch" entry commented out (unless spoofing a matching OS Patch Level with system= or all= in Tricky Store's security_patch.txt; autopif2 will do this automatically if security_patch.txt exists in the Tricky Store directory), but to achieve <A13 DEVICE integrity (with Tricky Store default AOSP software keybox.xml) requires at least "spoofProps" enabled, and some fingerprints may also require "spoofProvider". More known working private fingerprints can achieve <A13 DEVICE/STRONG integrity on more devices using these Advanced Settings in conjunction with Tricky Store than was possible with Tricky Store alone since they require fingerprint props spoofing.

## About Scripts-only mode

An advanced feature intended for older Android <10 ROMs, mostly stock ROMs or those with stock-like values, (and some other rare special cases), since they generally only need a few prop changes to pass Play Integrity <A13 DEVICE verdict. Due to this the majority of the previous information does not apply to or contradicts that of Scripts-only mode, so to avoid confusion it's contained in the Details area below.

<details>
<summary><strong>Details</strong></summary>

- Manually opt-in by creating a file named scripts-only-mode in the module directory, either from a root prompt with `mkdir -p /data/adb/modules/playintegrityfix; touch /data/adb/modules/playintegrityfix/scripts-only-mode` or from a file explorer app, and then re/flashing the module. Scripts-only mode will remain enabled until this file is removed and the module is reflashed again.

- During install all unused default mode files (including custom.pif.json) are removed from the module directory, effectively disabling the Zygisk components of PIF: attestation fallback and device spoofing. You'll see "Scripts-only mode" indicated in the module description in your root manager app.

- For best results, you should still most likely enable Magisk's Enforce DenyList option if NOT also using [Shamiko](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed.github.io/releases) or [Zygisk Assistant](https://github.com/snake-4/Zygisk-Assistant). The module will automatically add the Google Play Services DroidGuard process (com.google.android.gms.unstable) to the Magisk DenyList, if missing, since for Scripts-only mode it's necessary on some configurations (generally Android 9).

</details>

## About skipping property deletion

An advanced feature (unrelated to Play Integrity) intended for those who also need to use apps which detect prop tampering. To avoid triggering these detections by skipping any `resetprop --delete` commands in the module scripts, manually opt-in by creating a file named skipdelprop in the module directory after installation, either from a root prompt with `touch /data/adb/modules/playintegrityfix/skipdelprop` or from a file explorer app, then reboot.
